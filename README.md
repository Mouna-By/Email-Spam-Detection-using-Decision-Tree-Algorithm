### Email-Spam-Detection-using-Decision-Tree-Algorithm
This project aims to develop an email spam detection system using the Decision Tree algorithm. By leveraging the power of machine learning and natural language processing techniques, the system analyzes email content and identifies whether it is spam or not. The Decision Tree algorithm is employed to build a predictive model based on various features extracted from the email text. 
 Through this project, accurate and efficient spam detection is achieved, contributing to improved email filtering and user experience.
